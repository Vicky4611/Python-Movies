**Movie Correlation Analysis**:
This Python project analyzes correlations between movie attributes and gross earnings to identify trends and patterns in the movie industry.

**Overview**:
The purpose of this project is to explore the relationships between various movie attributes and their corresponding gross earnings at the box office. By analyzing a dataset containing information such as votes, budget, and production company, we aim to uncover correlations that can help understand the factors influencing a movie's financial success.

**Key Findings**:
**Votes and Budget:** The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between votes and gross earnings, as well as between budget and gross earnings. Movies with higher budgets and those that receive more votes tend to perform better financially.

**Production Company:** On the other hand, the correlation between the production company and gross earnings is relatively low. This suggests that the involvement of a specific production company may have less influence on a movie's financial success compared to factors like budget and audience reception.

**Features**:
**Correlation Calculation:** Calculate correlation coefficients between various movie attributes and gross earnings.
**Visualization:** Visualize correlation results using plots and charts for better interpretation.
**User Interface:** Provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the analysis tool and explore correlations.
